<H2>Special note with regard to liability</H2>

<P>PsyScript may appear to be in a special situation with regard to liability because it can be used in medical or psychological trials to assess patient-reaction to treatments.  However, PsyScript was developed as a teaching and academic research tool.  PsyScript was not designed to be the last word in medical testing facilities: it did not have a multi-million euro development programme behind it and it has not been subject to a barrage of tests and quality assurance processes.</P>

<P>The developer of PsyScript does not assure users of the accuracy, precision, or consistency of the results it produces.  Although effort has gone into ensuring that PsyScript does what it purports to do, no warranty is made that the software is of sufficient quality to make it suitable for use in medical trials.  Any responsibility for any trials, tests, examinations or experiments done with PsyScript is completely rejected by the developer and the organisation PsyScript was developed for.</P>

<P>PsyScript may, however, turn out to be the correct tool for administering your tests.  If you wish to use PsyScript as a serious test administration platform, perform your own tests on your own setup (software <EM>and hardware</EM>) and assure yourself that that your particular setup will provide results which satisfy your requirements.</P>
